# Python Crasher
A python script created purely for the sake of it. Will crash Python, but not permanently. Code MAY NOT be used for malicious purposes.

## How does it work?
Python usually raises an exception when a loop is repeating too many times (`RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`). However, a `try` loop allows for the handling of this exception and  simply can restart the program. That is how this program works.
